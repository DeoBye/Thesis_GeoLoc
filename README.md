## Recent Work Update

### Dataset
- Downloaded the **NUS dataset** (~25,000 images) provided by Hao for testing purposes.

### Training Progress
- Successfully ran the training process using the provided code.
- Noted that the original code did not include the step for adding noise to the location embeddings, as described in the paper. Implemented this step manually.

### Findings
- Trained the model for 20 epochs using a batch size of 64:
  - Adding noise to the embeddings resulted in a lower final loss compared to training without noise.
  - Convergence was faster with noise addition.
- Evaluated performance based on the distance between predictions and labels at thresholds of 1, 25, 200, 750, and 2500 km.
- Compared results between two models:
  - **Model 1**: Trained on my own data.
  - **Model 2**: Pretrained model provided by the author, validated on the same dataset.
- **Observations**:
  - My trained model performed worse at the 1 km threshold but achieved better accuracy at all other distances.

### Challenges
- The loss function could potentially be further optimized.
- Observed that while loss decreases, performance improves across all distance thresholdsâ€”except for the 1 km threshold, where accuracy declines. This behavior is puzzling and warrants further investigation.
