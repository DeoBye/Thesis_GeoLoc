## Recent Work Update  11.5 - 11.19

### Dataset
- Downloaded partial [**NUS Global Streetscapes**](https://ual.sg/project/global-streetscapes/) dataset (~25,000 images).

### Training
- Successfully ran the training process using the provided code.
- Noted that the original code did not include the step for adding noise to the location embeddings, as described in the paper. Implemented this step manually.

### Findings
- Trained the model for 20 epochs using a batch size of 64:
  - Adding noise to the embeddings resulted in a lower final loss compared to training without noise.
  - seems convergence was faster with noise addition.
- Evaluated performance based on the distance between predictions and labels at 1, 25, 200, 750, and 2500 km.
- Compared results between two models:
  - **Model 1**: Trained on our data.
  - **Model 2**: Pretrained model provided by the author, validated on the same dataset.
- **Observations**:
  - Our trained model performed worse at the 1 km threshold but achieved better accuracy at all other distances.

### Challenges
- Seems the loss function could be optimized.
- Observed that while loss decreases, performance improves across all distance thresholdsâ€”except for the 1 km threshold, where accuracy declines.

#### Dataset
- Continued using the Streetscapes dataset.

#### Experiment: Triplet Loss in GeoClip
- Modified GeoClip to use triplet loss as the objective function:
  - For each training data point, selected 5x batch size locations from the GPS gallery as neighbors.
  - Experimented with different strategies for selecting negative samples:
    1. Selected only the farthest locations as negatives.
    2. Combined the farthest locations with nearby hard negatives.
  - Used L2 norm as the distance function (default in triplet loss) and compared it with cosine similarity for consistency with GeoClip's inference approach.

#### Results
- Performance observations:
  - Overall performance with hard negatives outperformed using only farthest negatives but still fell short of GeoClip.
  - Accuracy at the 1 km threshold improved.
  - Using cosine distance for triplet loss led to faster convergence compared to L2 norm, but the final performance was worse.

### 17.12.2024

#### Experiment: Contrastive Loss (InfoNCE)
- GeoClip originally uses random negatives from previous batches.
- Modified approach to select 64 negatives for each data point:
  - Half selected as far negatives.
  - Half selected as hard nearby negatives.

#### Additional Work
- Familiarized with the **im2gps3k** and **yfcc16k** datasets.
- Tested model on **im2gps3k** dataset to benchmark against GeoClip.

#### Results
- Performance on the im2gps3k dataset was worse compared to GeoClip.

#### Dataset
- Downloaded the **MP-16 Dataset** (4.7M images), used for GeoClip training.
- Used 5% of MP-16 for training.

#### Experiment
- Focused on hyperparameter tuning.

#### Results
- Achieved results comparable to GeoClip.
